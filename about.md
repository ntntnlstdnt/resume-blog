I have a Bachelors Degree in Aerospace Engineering from University of Michigan
and a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Western Michigan University.

While at Western Michigan University, I researched under
[Professor Peter Gustafson](https://wmich.edu/mechanical-aerospace/directory/gustafson)
and [Dr. Andrew Geeslin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-geeslin-1760b74/). I
successfully defended my [masters thesis](http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/masters_theses/548/)
under their tutelage and learned a lot along the way.

I am interested in the intersection of Data Science and engineering.
